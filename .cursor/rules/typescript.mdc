- Use stricest typescript rules.
- Prefer type over interface when possible.
- Don't use enums, annotate objects with `as const`.
- Prefer `unknown` over `any`.
- Avoid return types if possible, prefer inference.
- Write type safe code, use `zod` for runtime validation.
- Use descriptive variable names with auxiliary verbs (e.g., isLoading, hasError).
- Use functional and declarative programming patterns; avoid classes.
