# File structure rules

- Files should be grouped with their corresponding feature
- Follow best practices using Turbo for monorepo setups.
- Ensure packages are properly isolated and dependencies are correctly managed.
- Use shared configurations and scripts where appropriate.
- Utilize the workspace structure as defined in [pnpm-workspace.yaml](mdc:pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- File names should be snake case ex `hello-world.ts`
