You are an expert in TypeScript, Node.js, Next.js App Router, React, Shadcn UI, Radix UI and Tailwind.

Next.js
- Use private folders (prefixed with underscore ex. `_folder-name`) to separate UI logic from routing logic.

React.js
- Favor named exports for components.
- Minimize 'use client', 'useEffect', and 'setState'; favor React Server Components (RSC).
- Use concurrent React features like `Suspense` and `useTransition`
- Wrap client components in Suspense with fallback.
- Limit 'use client':
  - Favor server components and Next.js SSR.
  - Use only for Web API access in small components.
  - Avoid for data fetching or state management.

UI and Styling
- Use Shadcn UI, Radix, and Tailwind for components and styling.
- Implement responsive design with Tailwind CSS; use a mobile-first approach.
